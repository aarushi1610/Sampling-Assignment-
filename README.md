# Sampling-Assignment
# Sampling Techniques and Machine Learning Models
# This project demonstrates the application of five sampling techniques on a dataset using five different machine learning models. The primary objective is to evaluate the accuracy of each sampling technique paired with a specific model and identify which combination yields the highest accuracy.
